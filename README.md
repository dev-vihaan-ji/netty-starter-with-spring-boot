# Project for Netty beginners

---
## **Overview**

ðŸ“– Netty is a Java-based asynchronous network application framework.
Developers who are typically familiar with web development or mobile development often don't know much about Netty.

1. In this project, For developers who are interested in diving into server-side network programming.


2. you will be able to practice Java-based network programming concepts and learn the basic concepts and usage of Netty using Java and Spring Boot over the course of a week.


3. Spring Boot is a framework that allows you to quickly and easily build web applications.
   By combining these two frameworks, you can develop a powerful asynchronous network server.


4. Using the current developer's practical experience and Netty's powerful performance, we will be able to implement a simple network server within a week.

## **Project Environment (Pre-requisites required)**
1. IDEA Intellij (Ultimate version is paid, but available for free for university students)


2. Oracle / JDK 17 version / Windows 10


3. GIT installation (GIT BASH required)
   The environment I have set up is based on what I often use, so if you cannot replicate the same environment as above, you can still proceed.
